# Roster-value-analysis(NBA)
NBA roster value analysis focused on replacement-level impact and cost efficiency. In an effort to bolster my resume and expand my python and data visualization for a prospective team.

## Project Goal
Analyze how efficiently NBA teams convert salary and roster spots into on-court value relative to replacement-level players.

## Status
Phase 1 (NBA) — Week 1: Project setup and data ingestion

## Planned Focus
- Replacement-level definition
- Value above replacement (VAR)
- Salary efficiency
- Roster construction insights

## Data Sources (Planned)
- Player impact metrics (DARKO)
- Salary data (Basketball-Reference)
- Playing time (Basketball-Reference)

## Insights (2025-26)
- Cost efficiency is driven by minutes + impact, not impact alone—high-impact players who play limited minutes rarely rate as top “value” contracts.
- Teams with high total roster value tend to have depth in the +VAR tier, not just one superstar outlier
- The model surfaces potential inefficiencies where mid-tier salaries produce near-replacement value, a common roster construction trap
- Minimum/low-salary players with stable rotation minutes can generate outsized value-per-dollar even if their absolute value is modest
- This framework provides a repeatable lens for identifying bargain rotation archetypes (e.g., defense-first wings, rim-running bigs) before adding age/contract context.
